**How does it work?**
Sign in using with your mobile (SMS verification). Join the queue, we'll match you with a stranger, and you'll receive a call from our bot.

**How does it keep me anonymous?**
It calls you! The bot sets up a conference call between you and your stranger. We call you via a landline, and merge you in once you accept. No data/phone number is shared between you and your matched caller. Think about how Uber handles calls between you and your driver.
